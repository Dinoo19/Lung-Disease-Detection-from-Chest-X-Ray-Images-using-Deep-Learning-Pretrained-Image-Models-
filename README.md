# Lung-Disease-Detection-from-Chest-X-Ray-Images-using-Deep-Learning-Pretrained-Image-Models-
This project uses deep learning models (ResNet-50, VGG-16) to detect lung diseases such as COVID-19, viral pneumonia, and normal conditions from chest X-ray images. It applies image preprocessing with CLAHE to enhance contrast and achieve accurate, automated diagnosis.
